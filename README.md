# acceleration-diffeos

Nonparametric image and shape (2D or 3D) regression based on the papers:

Fishbaugh, J. and Gerig, G. *Acceleration Controlled Diffeomorphisms For Nonparametric Image Regression*. IEEE ISBI. 2019

Fishbaugh, J., Durrleman, S., Gerig, G. *Estimation of smooth growth trajectories with controlled acceleration from time series shape data* MICCAI. 2011.

This software is based heavily on the code base of **Deformetrica** http://www.deformetrica.org.
